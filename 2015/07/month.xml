	<notes>Puzzled Pint was founded in Portland, Oregon.  For our fifth birthday, we returned to our roots.

Thanks to the [Portland Puzzled Pint](https://twitter.com/puzzpintpdx) organizers for writing all of this month's puzzles!  But really, Portland would like to thank all the amazing guest authors who are contributing puzzles to the event each and every month.  There was a time when all puzzles came from Portland, and we really appreciate the breathing room.
