			<title>Don't Panic</title>
            <notes>Milliways is known throughout the galaxy as a great place to get a meal while watching the universe end all around you. Five friends, Beeblebrox, Dent, Marvin, Prefect, and Trillian stopped by to grab a bite. Each brought with them an essential travel item (face flannel, gnat spray, a space suit, a towel and wet weather gear), ordered a different dish (fairy cake, flank steak, Ameglian Major Cow, peanuts, and sandwiches), and ordered a different drink (Gargleblaster, Gee-N-N-Tâ€™N-ix, Jinond-o-nicks, Jynnantonnyx, and a drink from the Nutri-matic). Can you deduce from the given clues which friend ordered which meal and drink, brought which item, and the order in which they arrived at Milliways?</notes>
