Hints
=====

The list of numbers on the tape tell you how long each word is.

Look for the two pair you can easily stitch together based on their edges:

WEMOVE and AYWEWA

There are only a few spots where "we move" (4 2) fit the word pattern. Try starting off using it for the first two words of the song.
