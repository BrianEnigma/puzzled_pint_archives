1 - The clues have been given to you in numerical order, from 1 to 36.










2 - Leave the poker chips until later in the puzzle.








3 - The numbers on the inner ring tell you word lengths










4 - The answers to the clues appear to have something missing.








5 - That something is very much related to their clue number and the roulette wheel.











5 - Black numbered clues all have answers: BLACK _____, red numbered clues all have answers RED _______. (Word lengths given by the inner ring of numbers ignore BLACK/RED)

8 - Number 1 has four chips on it. So, you should very much look at the fourth letter of the answer to clue 1 (ignoring BLACK/RED, of course). Note - no chips = no letter from that word.





9 - In clue order, you've probably got gibberish. If only there was another order....
