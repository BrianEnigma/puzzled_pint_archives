Pick Up Lines

Pat and Chris never had much luck with their pick-up lines, but after trying to chat up each other at a bar, they realized they'd been mixing up the first and second parts of each pick-up line!

A       Are you a parking ticket?                       0       But I can make your bed rock!
B       Are you an alien?                               2       Can I have yours?
C       Are you from Tennessee?                         3       Because you just swept me off my feet.
D       Can I borrow your library card?                 6       Cause you got FINE written all over you.
F       Do you believe in love at first sight?          6       Or do you want me to walk by again?
G       Do you have a mirror in your pocket?            11      Cause I'm checking you out.
H       Do you know karate?                             13      Because you just abducted my heart.
I       I lost my phone number.                         14      Cause I can see myself in your pants.
J       I'm feeling a little off today.                 14      Or is that just my heart taking off?
L       I'm no Fred Flintstone.                         14      I just can't hold it in.
M       Is there an airport nearby?                     14      Because Jamaican me crazy.
N       My love for you is like diarrhea.               15      Would you like to turn me on?
P       You must be a broom.                            17      Because you're the only ten I see!
Q       You must be Jamaican.	                        21      Cause your body is really kickin'.
