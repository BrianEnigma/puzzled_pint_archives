	<notes>Thanks to Portland regular Andrea Blumberg for writing this month's puzzles and story!  Beautiful artwork from Graeme McMillan.  Special thanks to Rick Rubenstein. 

Like Andrea's puzzles as much as we do?  Check out the amazing [Princess Bride puzzle set](http://www.puzzledpint.com/puzzles/may-2014/) she wrote for the May 2014 Puzzled Pint or her [Mythology puzzle set](http://www.puzzledpint.com/puzzles/march-2015/) from March 2015.

Printing instructions:

- Print 1a on the back of 1b, and 2a on the back of 2b.
- Choose “shrink to fit” and make sure that all pages (including the magnifying glasses
page) are shrunk by the same percentage.
- Page orientations:
    - 1a – “Dead Drunk” is at the top of the page
    - 1b – The page number “1” in the circle is at the top left of the page
    - 2a – The page number “2” in the circle is at the top right of the page
    - 2b – The page number “3” in the circle is at the top left of the page
- Fold into a booklet, with "Dead Drunk" as the cover and the dartboard on the inside
spread.
- If you have a duplex printer, you can just print the “pages all in one file” pdf and it
should print them on the correct sides automatically. Remember to choose “shrink to
fit” and shrink the magnifying glasses sheet by the same amount.
- Another good option is to have the pages printed at a Fed Ex, UPS store, or similar
printing shop. They will print, fold and staple them for about $.30 per booklet (Fed Ex)
or $.20 per booklet (UPS). (Prices checked in Portland, may be different where you
are). Give them the “pages all in one file” version.
- Using a laser printer is preferable to an ink jet, if possible, because there will be less
bleed-through.
