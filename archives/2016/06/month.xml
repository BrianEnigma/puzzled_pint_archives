		<title>Shifty Saul's Taxy Tour</title>
        <notes>This puzzle is distributed between the map and the answer sheet.</notes>
        <hint>You're looking to match one brewery to each beer.</hint>
        <hint>The brewery names all have something in common with each other — and with the name of the tour.</hint>
        <hint>Brewery Solutions: In order, the clues match up to these breweries:

- Sexy
- Galaxy
- Epoxy
- Proxy
- Foxy
- Apoplexy
- Orthodoxy</hint>
        <hint>Each brewery name ends in XY. The X &amp; Y, along with the + or -, is a clue about what to do next.</hint>
        <hint>XY is a clue about using the X and Y axes along the edges of the map.</hint>
        <hint>Use the letter and number of each brewery's coordinate, along with the +/-, to perform a letter shift.</hint>

        <notes>This puzzle is distributed between the map and the answer sheet.</notes>
        <hint>You're looking to make pairs of streets.</hint>
        <hint>The name of this tour is a spoonerism for Bonnie and Clyde.</hint>
        <hint>The first pair is Dick St. and Qwerty St.</hint>
        <hint>… which spoonerizes to the common phrase "quick and dirty".</hint>
        <hint>You want to pairs all 22 streets to get 11 common X AND Y phrase.</hint>
        <hint>Street pairs:

- Far/Tether = Tar and Feather
- Sarte/Hole = Heart and Soul</hint>
        <hint>Each pair of streets is a clue for a brewery whose name is related to the spoonerized phrase.</hint>
        <hint>Write the street names in the blanks and notice which letters are shaded.</hint>
        <hint>Brewery Solutions:

- Quick and Dirty = Makeshift

		<title>Crow's Flying Helicopter Tour</title>
        <notes>This puzzle is distributed between the map and the answer sheet.</notes>
        <hint>The clues here are “end to end”, “a different kind of beer while in each flight” and "path.”</hint>
        <hint>There are eight breweries on the tour, but the answer will only be seven letters.</hint>
        <hint>You're looking to pair up breweries that are on either end of a tour leg.</hint>
        <hint>The first leg goes from APT PUPILS to NERDGLAM.</hint>
        <hint>For the two breweries on either end of a leg, take the last part of one and the first part of another to get a type of beer. For example, on leg one, you can find PILSNER inside APTPUPILSNERDGLAM.</hint>
        <hint>Itineray:

- Apt Pupils → Nerdglam = PILSNER
- Nerdglam → Bermuda Gambit = AMBER
- Bermuda Gambit → Terrible Ghost = BITTER
- Terrible Ghost→ Outlandport = STOUT
- Outlandport → Errata = PORTER
- Errata → Leila = ALE
- Leila → Germaniacs = LAGER</hint>
        <hint>Now draw lines on the map to indicate the helicopter paths.</hint>
        <hint>The lines will intersect with the neighborhood names at 7 different letters.</hint>

        <hint>There are nine such column-halfs (each is a 1x8 strip).</hint>
        <hint>If you cut them out from the map, you’ll notice they all have lakes and rivers.</hint>
        <hint>By arranging the nine halves so the water lines up, it spells …</hint>

		<title>My Underground Brewery</title>

        <hint>Each beer has five underlined phrases, and there are five parts to each beer.</hint>
        <hint>Each underlined phrase matches up with one of the ingredients.</hint>
        <hint>Each beer story includes...

- A word or phrase that includes the letters GRAIN
- A word or phrase that includes the letters HHO (i.e. H20, or water)
- A word or phrase that rhymes with “yeast”
- A creature or thing that hops
- An anagram of a name of a fruit</hint>
        <hint>For each beer, the five initial letters each ingredient form 5/6 of a six-letter word.</hint>
        <hint>The definition for each of those six-letter words is a beer’s name on the left side of the page.</hint>
