		<hint>Now you can link the pairs together across the "As" in one of two ways, either by keeping the same Analogous relationship, or by matching elements belonging to the set themes.</hint>
		<hint>'AS' PAIRING HINTS:

- Baseball is a game, mostly played where?
- For what non-cleaning task can a broom be used, and by whom? What do you decorate at Christmas?
- Have you looked up the meanings of those idioms?
- Shift-1 vs Shift-7?

- The ring is a Stargate
- What's another name for a maze?
- Where can you find animals?
- Which role-playing game was featured in the show?
- Who painted the Mona Lisa?</hint>
		<hint>LIST OF ANALOGIES USED:

- Action : Thing Acted Upon
- Definition : Animal Idiom
- Malicious Intent : Mechanism to Achieve It Member : Writing-based Set
- Peer : Peer in the same category
- PigPen : English
- Place : Action
- Reverse thing : Thing

		<hint>Note the + and Equal signs. This will help you to fill in the __ . before each meta answer</hint>
		<hint>Sum the two numbers from the pair on the left of the equals, then subtract the one number you have from its corresponding pair to the right of the equals, this give the missing number.</hint>
		<hint>Index each meta answer by the number you found to get the final answer.</hint>
