WHO AM I? SOLUTION

Firstly note that this puzzle was contained in a day of puzzles about Nursery Rhymes.



Find words hidden in the grid based on the ten words.



I don't have the official solution here, so I'm partially guessing (for number 10), but the answers to the lines are:
MALT, RAT, CAT, DOG, COW, MAIDEN, MAN, PRIEST, COCK, COCK, FARMER??


In the wordsearch, they found words make the shape of a house...




Someone built the house, so, Who Am I?



Think nursery rhymes....



The answer is JACK as in The House That Jack Built.
