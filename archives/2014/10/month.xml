			<hint>These Polaroids are from the past... [past Puzzled Pints](http://www.puzzledpint.com/puzzles/), to be exact!</hint>
			<hint>The numbers tell you what to do with the Polaroids. What time-based information do you have about each photo?</hint>
			<hint>Find the month when each photo was featured. Use the number to index into the month name and extract a letter!</hint>
			<hint>"Restore the timeline" by placing the letters in chronological order (look at when the Puzzled Pint events happened).</hint>
			<hint>The solution is: Mr. Fusion</hint>

        <hint href="01-1885-hint.pdf"/>
        <hint>Except for the cells with intersections, you must enter/exit each cell on exactly two sides. If you establish two of those, you can draw the track.</hint>
        <hint>If you can eliminate one side of a cell containing a station, you know which two sides must be passed through.</hint>
        <hint>You can't position track that will cause you to create a loop before entering every cell.</hint>
        <hint>For an idea on how to begin the extraction, read the end of the flavortext.</hint>
