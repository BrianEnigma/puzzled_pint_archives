HINTS:

1. Did you notice anything "subliminal" toward the end of the video?

2. Did you notice that the video clips are running backwards?

3. This video hides a backwards Morse code message.  Each clip,
featuring a Twin Peaks actor appearing on another show, represents a
different symbol:
- Carnivale (Michael J. Anderson) is a SEPARATOR;
- Portlandia (Kyle MacLachlan) is a DASH; and
- Reaper (Ray Wise) is a DOT.
Read the entire sequence backwards to get the answer!

#

HOW IT WORKS:

The video contains clips from three(3) different TV shows featuring
actors who were on Twin Peaks:
- Carnivale (Michael J. Anderson)
- Portlandia (Kyle MacLachlan)
- Reaper (Ray Wise)

The "subliminal" bits at the end of the video tell you how to
translate each clip into a Morse code symbol:
- Carnivale = / (separator)
- Portlandia = - (dash)
- Reaper = . (dot)

Because the video runs backwards, you must REVERSE the entire string
of symbols to get the correct letters--i.e., the symbols which make up
each letter are in backwards order, and the overall answer word is
also spelled backwards.
