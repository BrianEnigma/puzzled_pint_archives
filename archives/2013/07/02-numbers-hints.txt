Numbers Station Hints
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The internet technology used to deliver the numbers station stream is a means to an end.  Don't try to read anything in to the server, serving mechanism, or timing differences in two different devices buffering the same stream.  Pretend you're listening on a timeless old transistor radio and forget that there's an internet layer between you and the audio.

- You can confirm that you have the correct sequence of digits, if you'd like...
