1. Do the answer items have any common properties?
2. Don't look at the words, the letters, or even the categories.  Do the answer items have common physical properties, such as shape?
3. Treat oblong or tall items as dashes.  Treat round items as dots.
4. But where are the word breaks?  Each bullet point of question-answering in the flavor text is one Morse code letter, so the final answer is 12 letters long.
5. Eight Magnums
