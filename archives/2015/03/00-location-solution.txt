The animated graphic sequentially adds one item from each picture, allowing us to create an order
of eight myths:
Minotaur
Golden Fleece
Prometheus
Pegasus
Pandora
Atlas
Cyclops
Medusa

The animated graphic also gives a sequence of numbers, which can be indexed into the names:
1 - M
9 - E
4 - M
2 - E
3 - N
2 - T
5 - O
5 - S

The puzzle solution is MEMENTOS.
