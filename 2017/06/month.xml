        <hint>the number of slots at the top of the switchboard wiring diagram is equal to the number of digits in the “international phone number” provided</hint>
        <hint>the funnel lines below the slots imply that what goes into each of the eight empty boxes is determined by three digits above</hint>
        <hint>each three digit set has a five in the middle, just like the phone pad shown, where all digits also connect to the five in the center</hint>
        <hint>each three digit set makes semaphore on the phone pad</hint>
        <hint>the eight letters for the empty boxes are: o, s, n, l, l, a, c, y</hint>
        <hint>follow the cables to populate the final message with those letters, sometimes in more than one place</hint>

		<title>A Still Tongue</title>
		<file href="03-still_tongue-puzzle.pdf"/>
        <hint>start at the upper left circle with “hook” and “crook” and think about what these words share, do not share, and how this relates to the bottom image in their circle</hint>
        <hint>in each circle, upper right words have five letters; upper left and bottom words have four; remove letters that the upper words have in common, and the remaining three, plus one you must add, make a word that describes the bottom image; e.g. Hook – CRook + I = RICH</hint>
        <hint>use solved circles to tell you what words to use for pictures in unsolved circles and continue the process for all the circles; e.g., when you solve Hook – Crook = RICH, look for the other circle with the RICH picture in the upper left and solve that one next, and so on</hint>
        <hint>ROW 1 PICTURES
            
- Hook, Crook, Rich
- Trap, Earth, Hemp

		<file href="06-bonus-puzzle.pdf"/>
        <hint>All the quotes are slightly wrong</hint>
        <hint>fix the incorrect word in each quote, then read the correct words from top to bottom, and do the same with the incorrect words</hint>
        <hint>CORRECT WORDS I got your number I need to make you mine Jenny</hint>
        <hint>INCORRECT WORDS white letters case sensitive phone number indicates which used for Gramogram</hint>
        <hint>LEFT BLANKS the Jenny quote implies the phone number: 8 7 6 5 3 0 9</hint>
        <hint>each quote has a white letter on black – instead of writing the phone number, write the case sensitive white letter from the quote of that number; e.g., instead of “eight” write a capital B because quote number eight highlights that letter</hint>
        <hint>CENTER BLANKS on the underscores at the bottom, you get the gramogram: BeC-ingU</hint>
