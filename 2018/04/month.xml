		<title>Genesis Block</title>
		<file href="01-genesis_block.pdf"/>
		<hint>"Cryptic" is a key word in the flavor text.</hint>
		<hint>Yup, it's a cryptic crossword. Don't know what that is? Check out [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptic_crossword) or use this handy [solving reference](https://s.wsj.net/blogs/html/wsjcrypticguide.pdf). If you're stuck, the next few hints will help in different ways:

- The next hint is a general clue about the answers
- The hint after that will show all the cryptic clues split by definition.
- The hint after that will show the cryptic clue type, without the split.</hint>
		<hint>All of the cryptic answers fit a theme.</hint>
		<hint>Here's how you can split those cryptic clues to get the correct definition:

1. Eugene's is holding / a bible book
2. The start / The start point on a graph
3. A sharp, acidic taste after the first serving / makes me jump
4. A graduation ceremony / remarks about males and cerium
5. DiCaprio movie / not in epic mix-up
6. Initially describing a whole new / daybreak
7. Found in whiteout setting / from the beginning</hint>
		<hint>Here's the type of each cryptic clue:

1. Hidden
2. Double definition &amp; lit.
3. Charade
4. Combination/Charade
5. Anagram
6. Hidden
7. Hidden</hint>
		<hint>Here's the answer to each cryptic, with an explanation

1. `genesis` -- hidden in "Eugene's is"
2. `origin` -- "the start" as well as the start point on a graph
3. `start` -- "first serving" becomes "s". A sharp, acidic taste is "tart".
4. `commencement` -- "males" becomes "men". "cerium" becomes "ce". "remarks" becomes "comment". Put "men" and "ce" in "comment" you get `com + men + ce + ment`
5. `inception` -- "not in epic" anagrams (mixes up) to this answer.
6. `dawn` -- the initials of "describing a whole new"
7. `outset` -- hidden in "whiteout setting"</hint>

		<title>Secret Keys</title>
		<file href="02-secret_keys.pdf"/>
		<hint>Key words in the flavor text are "based on 16" and "drop"</hint>
		<hint>It doesn't look like each column is limited only to numbers...</hint>
		<hint>This is a drop-quote puzzle, but with hex characters rather than letters. Each column of characters will fill in the columns below. You can then</hint>
		<hint>Good places to start:

- The first 2 columns (one's already filled in for you!)
- The 7th and 8th columns
- The 10th and 11th columns</hint>
		<hint>On your code sheet, the hex letters all start with either a 1 or a 0. All dropped pairs will start with a 1 or a 0.</hint>
		<hint>The top row is `14 08 05 13 05`</hint>
		<hint>The filled in message, in hex, is: `14 08 05 13 05 03 12 05 14 0B 05 19 09 13 03 04 16 05 12 14`</hint>
		<hint>Decoded, it reads "The secret key is covert".</hint>

		<title>Pintcoin Mining</title>
		<file href="03-pintcoin_mining.pdf"/>
		<hint>The "listen" word is the first key word you should pay attention to in the flavor text.</hint>
		<hint>It looks like the flavor text as a lot more stops and pauses than any of the other puzzles. That's odd.</hint>
		<hint>In fact, some of the flavor text looks darker than the rest.</hint>
		<hint>The dashes and periods seem more prominent than in other puzzles. I wonder if that's an encoded message...</hint>
		<hint>Decoding the flavortext with morse code gets you the message `DECODE ROWS`</hint>
		<hint>When looking at the transactions, the key phrases from the flavor text to keep in mind are "mine", "partially mine", and "mostly mine".</hint>
		<hint>Each transaction defines a word that fits a mine pattern. Either: * It will have 'mine' somewhere in the word * It will have 'mine' with a letter missing. For instance, "limited" is partially mined, since it has "mine" in it without the "n". (That's not one of these answers, btw.)</hint>
		<hint>Here's each word associated with the definition:

- The management - `ADMINISTRATION`
- A person who has regard for someone - `ADMIRER`
- A mutual settlement - `COMPROMISE`
- A person who builds complex products - `ENGINEER`
- To inspect closely - `EXAMINE`
- The 3rd zodiac sign - `GEMINI`
- Unable to catch a disease - `IMMUNE`
- Describing a straight path - `LINEAR`
- A periodical - `MAGAZINE`
- A warship - `MINESWEEPER`
- Extremely small - `MINUTE` (`MINUSCULE` would also work)
- Consisting of different elements - `MIXED`
- Officially coined currency - `MONEY`
- A candidate for office - `NOMINEE`
- Continuing without change - `PERMANENT`</hint>
		<hint>For each transaction, which "mine" part is present? Where does it appear in the word?</hint>
		<hint>Here's how to arrange the transactions in the grid, by the word they resolved to:

- `MINE`: Minesweeper, Nominee, Examine
- `_INE`: Linear, Engineer, Magazine
- `M_NE`: Money, Permanent, Immune
- `MI_E`: Mixed, Admirer, Compromise
- `MIN_`: Minute, Administration, Gemini</hint>
		<hint>Did you notice that the definitions also have bolded pauses? Where have we seen that before?</hint>
		<hint>With the definitions in the correct place on the grid, decode each row using the same morse technique we used in the flavortext.</hint>

		<title>Initial Coin Offering</title>
		<notes>[Optional data](04-initial_coin_offering-hints.pdf) is available, if desired.</notes>
		<file href="04-initial_coin_offering.pdf"/>
		<hint>"exponential" is the key word in the flavortext.</hint>
		<hint>Bale &amp; Carell were in The Big Short</hint>
		<hint>Aykroyd &amp; Murphy were in Trading Places</hint>
		<hint>Bale &amp; Cumberbatch were superheros.</hint>
		<hint>Simmons &amp; Aykroyd were born in the 1950s.</hint>
		<hint>Bale never hosted SNL.</hint>
		<hint>Simmons bought the most Pintcoin.</hint>
		<hint>Here's what each celebrity bought:

- Bale: 10,000,000
- Aykroyd: 1,000
- Carell: 10,000
- Murphy: 100,000
- Moss: 1,000,000,000
- Johansson: 100,000,000</hint>
		<hint>What's another way to write those numbers, using the key word in the flavor text?</hint>
		<hint>Try indexing into each actor's name.</hint>

		<title>Altcoins (meta puzzle)</title>
		<file href="05-meta.pdf"/>
		<hint>The key phrases in the flavor text are "only some will matter" and "buy the right ones at the right time".</hint>
		<hint>Which are the right ones? Maybe the ones you're familiar with...</hint>
		<hint>Look at the Altcoin Abbreviations. Do some altcoins look familiar?</hint>
		<hint>The only altcoins you care about are: Block Dollars (BKD), Covert Bucks (CBX), DigiCreation (DCN) and InvestBits (IVB)</hint>
		<hint>The only days you care about are:

- In column one: Days 2, 4, 5, 7, and 9
- In column two: Days 12, 13, 16 and 18
- In column three: Days 21, 22, 24, 26, 27 and 29</hint>
		<hint>In chronological order, the buy price for an altcoin we care about is: `19 16 5 3 21 12 1 20 5 23 9 12 4 12 25`</hint>
		<hint>Which encoding on your sheet seems to work well for numbers in this range?</hint>
