#Pan-Alphabetic Gargle Blaster Hints

- Focus on the paragraphs first, not the symbols.
- Have you noticed the name of the puzzle? "Pan-Alphabetic" instead of "Pan-Galactic"?
- Pan-Alphabetic sounds conceptually similar to Pangram. (Google it!) "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
- Is there something a little off about the pangram paragraphs?
- For each paragraph, find the letter that isn't used.
- SWAP DOT DASH
- The code around the outside is Morse code, but you'll have to replace dots with dashes and vice-versa
